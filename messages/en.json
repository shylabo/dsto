    "hero": "Hello, we are a design firm based in Japan.</br></br>We value unconscious gestures and trivial psychology that we glimpse at moments in our daily lives. Sometimes we tolerate people's laziness and view life with a generous heart. We try to touch materials and objects that we usually use without thinking about them with new feelings. We go back and reconsider the common sense and rules that have been set in stone.  What we value in design is to observe daily life from a pure perspective, to discover the values that emerge, and to make them permeate into the lives of those who use and view them,</br>We then refine and refine it to a form that will permeate the user and the viewer, and give it a new form.</br></br>We also place importance on the fact that we are not only designers, but also users. We approach design not only from the perspective of the creator, but also from the perspective of the user who actually touches the product. We work together as partners who can exchange opinions without any discovery through proposals that have been thought through from these multifaceted perspectives.",
