    "hero": "We are a design office based in Fukuoka and Tokyo. The unconscious gestures and psychology that can be glimpsed in moments in our lives, sometimes revealed by allowing people to be lazy. What we value in our design work is to find new values that emerge from our observation of people's lives, and to embody them while refining them to a form that will permeate the user.</br></br>We also place importance on the fact that we are not only designers but also consumers. We look at design not only from the creator's point of view, but also from the point of view of the user who will actually touch the product. We work together as partners who can exchange opinions without any discovery through proposals that have been thought through from these multifaceted perspectives.",
